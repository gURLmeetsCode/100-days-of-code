# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Focused on improving and solifying object orintation programming standards. Wanted to avoid anti-patterns and build code with proportion, symmetry, and integrity.

**Thoughts:** : I struggled through this! I will need more practice with this concept

### Day 2: June 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to test out a new technology -- Vue.js. I know React is very popular right now so I just wanted to see what else is out there.

**Thoughts:**: My initial thoughts are the framework has alot of little nuances however I seemed to understand this better than React.

### Day 3: June 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on MySQL tutorial on Learn.co and Code School. This topic is part of the curriculum and I wanted to mak sure I have a deep understanding. I also worked on my portfolio -- I am so proud of what I was able to accomplish. 

**Thoughts:**: Today was hard -- not from the learning material but I was just tired and overloaded.

### Day 4: June 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on deployment! My initial goal was to deploy using firebase but I ran into some difficulty. Not with firebase but with Next.js. So I decided to look into Heroku and Now ( a deployment feature from the creators of Next.js). In the end I went back to working with firebase.

**Thoughts:**: I did not get the site deployed due to errors with next build and next start. I will continue to work on this.

### Day 5: June 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I attended a video conference which covered how to build an Alexa Skill Set with AWS and Node.js.

**Thoughts:**: It was cool to see the functionalities of the device and how easy it is to create and publish a new skill.

### Day 6: June 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Today was a challenging day for me so I mainly focused on the Learn.co material.

**Thoughts:**: Speaking with Quincy Larson helped improve my day!!


### Day 7: June 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Today I built a small application using the Twitter API. The primary focus was to see how Big Data is collected and then used in Machine Learning. This project also helped me to refresh my python skills. 

**Thoughts:**: I think it is cool to see the power of Twitter and just how much user data it collects. This is also a bit scary to know nothing is "private".
