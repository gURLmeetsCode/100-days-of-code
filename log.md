**Today's Progress**: Focused on improving and solifying object orintation programming standards. Wanted to avoid anti-patterns and build code with proportion, symmetry, and integrity.

### Day 2: June 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to test out a new technology -- Vue.js. I know React is very popular right now so I just wanted to see what else is out there.

**Thoughts:**: My initial thoughts are the framework has alot of little nuances however I seemed to understand this better than React.
