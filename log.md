# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Focused on improving and solifying object orintation programming standards. Wanted to avoid anti-patterns and build code with proportion, symmetry, and integrity.

**Thoughts:** : I struggled through this! I will need more practice with this concept

### Day 2: June 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to test out a new technology -- Vue.js. I know React is very popular right now so I just wanted to see what else is out there.

**Thoughts:**: My initial thoughts are the framework has alot of little nuances however I seemed to understand this better than React.

### Day 3: June 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on MySQL tutorial on Learn.co and Code School. This topic is part of the curriculum and I wanted to mak sure I have a deep understanding. I also worked on my portfolio -- I am so proud of what I was able to accomplish. 

**Thoughts:**: Today was hard -- not from the learning material but I was just tired and overloaded.

### Day 4: June 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on deployment! My initial goal was to deploy using firebase but I ran into some difficulty. Not with firebase but with Next.js. So I decided to look into Heroku and Now ( a deployment feature from the creators of Next.js). In the end I went back to working with firebase.

**Thoughts:**: I did not get the site deployed due to errors with next build and next start. I will continue to work on this.
